This project is a graphing calculator made using JavaScript, inspired by the TI-84 calculator made by Texas Instruments. It has the ability to graph almost any function that can be graphed on a TI-84 (polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, etc.), and has features such as calculating the roots of an equation, or finding the intersection of two graphs. The project uses a library called [expr-eval](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expr-eval), which is used to interpret user-inputted math expressions, and webpack to bundle the JavaScript files.
